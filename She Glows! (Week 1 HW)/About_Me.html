      <h3>About Me</h3>

      <p>Hi! My name is Diana, I am 24 years old, and I was born and raised in New York City. My parents were born in the Dominican Republic, therefore, I am Hispanic. Fun fact: I am bilingual, Spanish being my native language. At the age of 18, I decided that I needed a change of scenery. For this reason, I moved to Massachusetts and never looked back.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am a medical assistant at a school for adolescents with brain injuries and other neurological challenges. I love what I do, however, I aspire to be a kick-ass web developer one day.</p>
      <p>She Glows, is about my life. The things I do, the food I eat, and the things that inspire me. Follow me as I live my life.</p>
