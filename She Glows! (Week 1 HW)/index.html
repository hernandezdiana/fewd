      <h3>Lazy Sunday</h3>

      <img src="images/Twin_Peaks.jpg" alt="Twin Peaks">

      <p>I have done absolutely nothing today and I’m not mad about it. Laying down and watching Netflix all day is my favorite Sunday activity. I am currently watching a series called Twin Peaks (1990). The series has two seasons (8 episodes in season 1 and 22 episodes in season 2), a total of thirty episodes. I’m on episode seventeen of the second season. ): I’m kind of sad because I’ve gotten pretty attached to this show. Although, I did read something about there being a remake or continuation of the show. I’ll have to look more into that.</p>

      <p>Now it would be wrong to not eat ice cream on this super hot lazy Sunday. Fun fact: I follow a vegan (plant-based) diet. Dairy free ice cream for the win! :D</p>
